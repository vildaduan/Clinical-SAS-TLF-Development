Clinical Trial Data Analysis: Demographic Summary (Table 14.1)📌 Project OverviewThis repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating a Table 14.1: Summary of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics, a core component of a Clinical Study Report (CSR).In clinical trials, this table is used to assess the success of randomization by comparing baseline characteristics (Age, Gender, Race) between the Active and Placebo treatment arms.🛠 Programming MethodologiesRather than providing a single script, this project showcases three distinct industry approaches to table generation, highlighting versatility in SAS programming:Tabulate Method: High-speed data exploration and internal summary reporting.Report Compute Method: Demonstrates advanced PROC REPORT logic by performing percentage calculations and denominators dynamically within the report procedure.Industry Standard (Stacked) Method: The gold standard for regulatory submissions (FDA/EMA). It uses a multi-step pipeline: Statistical Testing $\rightarrow$ Data Transposition $\rightarrow$ Concatenation $\rightarrow$ Final Reporting.📂 Repository StructureThe project is organized into a logical execution sequence:FileNameDescription0101_data_init.sasEnvironment Setup: Defines global options, clinical formats, and creates the mock ADSL (Analysis Data Subject Level) dataset.0202_tabulate_method.sasRapid Reporting: Uses PROC TABULATE for a concise, efficient summary of data.0303_report_method.sasAdvanced Report Logic: Showcases COMPUTE blocks to generate denominators and percentages on-the-fly.0404_clinical_standard.sasProduction Grade Table: Includes $p$-value calculations (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum & Fisher's Exact) and follows professional CSR formatting.📊 Statistical Methods AppliedTo ensure statistical rigor, the following tests are implemented in the 04_clinical_standard script:Continuous Variables (Age): Analyzed using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test (PROC NPAR1WAY) to compare medians across treatment groups.Categorical Variables (Gender/Race): Analyzed using Pearson’s Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact Test (PROC FREQ) to evaluate distributional balance.🚀 How to RunOpen your SAS environment (SAS OnDemand for Academics, SAS 9.4, or SAS University Edition).Run 01_data_init.sas first to initialize the WORK.DEMOG dataset and custom formats.Run any of the analysis scripts (02, 03, or 04) to view the resulting output in the Results/Output window.📝 Key Learning OutcomesData Reshaping: Proficiency in PROC TRANSPOSE to move data from a "Long" format to a "Wide" reporting format.Macro Integration: Use of CALL SYMPUT to dynamically populate population counts ($N=XX$) in column headers.Traceability: Ensuring that every number in the final PDF can be traced back to the source mock data.
